This repository contains the code and data for the CCoT project, which aims to advance long-text error correction in post-Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts using fine-grained contextual Chain-of-Thought.

### PALTEC Dataset
- **PALTEC**: Currently, we have only opened some examples of the entire test and training sets containing 20000 samples. Dataset samples can be queried in the 'data'.
- **Training** data and code: The entire training set and code will be made public after our paper is accepted.
- **MP3**: All MP3 audio files can be found [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16VJNLRMrAfk05htePZDQQQ?pwd=xmiz) to get (10.6GB)

**Notice**: The trainset and code will be released upon the acceptance of our paper. Stay tuned for updates!
